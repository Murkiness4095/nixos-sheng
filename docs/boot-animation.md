# Rounded boot animation

[简体中文](boot-animation_zh.md)

Normal boot uses a black background and the NixOS blues. Once the Linux framebuffer
is available, the two-tone Nix snowflake fades in. Soft light travels through its
six interlocking lambda arms while the upright mark breathes by at most 1.8%.
The `NixOS` wordmark accompanies it, with a muted `by dotredstone` credit anchored
to the screen's bottom-right corner. Stage
labels and colored battery-like bars have been removed. The rounded generation
menu retains its three-second timeout and volume-key selection. Selecting a
system returns to the same seamless animation through stage-1 and stage-2; the
display manager stops the writer before taking over scanout. No artificial
progress percentage or fixed animation delay is added. Offline charging keeps
its separate rounded battery with a gentle charging glow.

The generation menu uses the same baked snowflake, charcoal rounded cards,
blue selection outlines and a thin countdown track. Selection starts the loop
directly, without the old loading card; its fallback still matches the native
loop's first frame pixel for pixel. Stage-1 and the selected stage-2 generation
carry their own assets, so flashing only `boot_b` leaves the old system animation
in place. Update and activate the downstream system with the same platform commit.

Snowflake geometry is adapted from [NixOS artwork](https://github.com/NixOS/nixos-artwork/tree/master/logo),
by Simon Frankau and Tim Cuthbertson, under [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
This version retains deep blue `#5277C3` and light blue `#7EBAE4`, adding lighting
between 84–100% of each original color and scale animation. The corner credit
identifies this project's boot animation; it does not replace the logo attribution.

## Console and ownership

VT1 is reserved for the desktop, VT2 for the boot UI, and VT3–6 for diagnostics.
`fbcon=vc:3-6` keeps text off the UI even if the Android bootloader appends a louder
kernel log level. Logs remain in `dmesg`, the journal and `/run/log/stage-1.log`.
Press Esc on an external keyboard during the animation, or run
`sudo sheng-boot-details`, to reveal VT3 and disable animation for the current
boot. Stage-1 failure, emergency/rescue targets, display-manager failure and the
120-second animation limit also reveal diagnostics. `sheng.boot-ui=0` disables
the UI for one boot. Systems without a display manager return to the text console
at the end of early stage-2 activation.

The implementation uses the existing native SFB1 painter, with frames baked at
build time. It does not re-enable the LVGL boot path. The loop runs at 20fps and
updates only the central composition and corner credit. A 5760px master produces
720px and 1440px assets, with 8x and 4x supersampling respectively. Neutral tones
use 64 gray levels to smooth text edges and fades. Displays with
a short edge of at least 1600px use the 1440px asset without upscaling; smaller
displays use the 720px asset, scaled down when needed. File locks
exclude competing writers. Before switch_root, the child must load its frames
and open the control and VT descriptors it carries across the mount move. The
stage-2 service retires the old process before starting its own, freeing initrd
mappings. The display manager waits for an explicit stop acknowledgement.
Stage-2 waits for the first frame before allowing the display manager to start.
Once the desktop takes over, a per-boot completion marker prevents replaying the
animation during later system switches.
Early charger detection does not cache the normal-reboot marker before the root
filesystem has mounted.

Vendor logos and unlock warnings precede Linux and are outside this code's
control. An early kernel crash or an unavailable display driver may still
require serial/ADB diagnostics.

Enter fastboot manually on this device; do not rely on `adb reboot bootloader`.
Verify the installed `sheng-boot-splash` unit's `ExecStart` references the new
assets. Updating the development checkout or Home Manager alone does not update
the device's system service. Roll back both the boot image and system generation.

## Build, preview and deployment

```sh
nix build ./nixos#checks.aarch64-linux.bootAnimation --no-link
nix build ./nixos#checks.aarch64-linux.generationMenuRenderer --no-link
nix build ./nixos#checks.aarch64-linux.offlineCharging --no-link
nix build ./nixos#packages.aarch64-linux.mobileAndroidBootimg -o out/mobile-bootimg
nix build ./nixos#packages.aarch64-linux.mobileRootfsImage -o out/mobile-rootfs
```

This changes cmdline, stage-1, the shared painter and stage-2 services. Deploy a
matching `boot_b` and system generation or `linux/rootfs`; updating only one side
does not provide the complete handoff. Roll back both boot_b and the system
generation if needed. Physical boot/display acceptance is still pending.

With host-native painter/assets and Pillow, export GIFs directly from native
framebuffer bytes:

```sh
python3 scripts/preview-boot-animation.py "$PAINTER/bin/sheng-fb-painter" \
  "$ANIMATION" out/boot-animation-preview --menu out/rounded-generation-menu-preview
```

Generate the optional menu directory with `scripts/preview-generation-menu.py`.
Use `--width 3048 --height 2032` for native tablet landscape previews, or swap the
dimensions for portrait. Still PNGs retain native resolution; GIF and lossless
APNG previews default to a 1536px long edge to bound memory use. Set
`--animation-max-size 0` for native-resolution animations (tablet sizes need
several GB of memory). Inspect the
PNG for pixel detail, since GIF is limited to 256 colors.
The animation file-target mode never opens the host's real display. Tests cover
16/24/32bpp, padded strides, landscape/portrait/small screens, loop continuity,
writer exclusion, acknowledged stop, moved control directories, diagnostic
markers, malformed assets and charger/reboot-marker isolation.

After installing matching images, check cold boot, USB-connected normal reboot,
manual generation selection, charging-only boot, Esc/diagnostics, and desktop
handoff. Confirm no visible log flashes, no surviving animation writer, working
volume/power controls and healthy sensor/display-manager services. Charging must
retain the original battery, eight-second blanking and power-key wakeup.

```sh
systemctl status sheng-boot-splash display-manager --no-pager
journalctl -b -u sheng-boot-splash --no-pager
pgrep -af 'sheng-fb-painter.*--animate'
systemctl --failed --no-pager
cat /sys/class/tty/tty0/active
```
