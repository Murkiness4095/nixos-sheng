# Sheng Performance Policy

[简体中文](performance-tuning_zh.md)

The default policy aims to keep the desktop responsive under memory pressure
without pinning CPU, GPU, or UFS clocks. The existing `schedutil` and devfreq
governors already reach their lowest idle frequencies on tested hardware, so
clock-floor changes require separate performance-per-watt evidence.

## Defaults

`services.sheng-performance.enable` is enabled by default and applies:

- one zstd zram swap device with an uncompressed limit of 50% of physical RAM;
- `vm.swappiness=100`, so anonymous memory can use zram before reclaim becomes a
  long global stall;
- `vm.page-cluster=0`, because compressed RAM has no seek penalty and clustered
  swap-in can decompress pages that are never used;
- systemd-oomd monitoring for user slices, so sustained desktop memory pressure
  can be recovered before a kernel-wide OOM deadlock;
- at most two concurrent Nix derivations and four build cores per derivation for
  device-side builds;
- a CPU cgroup weight of 50 and best-effort I/O priority 6 for `nix-daemon`,
  allowing desktop and hardware services to win during contention. These
  settings do not cap idle throughput, and no hard memory limit is imposed on
  large builds.

The zram size is a logical limit. It does not reserve half of physical RAM.
Actual use and compression ratio are visible in `zramctl` and `mm_stat`.

## Report

Run the repository's read-only report script:

```sh
sudo ./scripts/collect-hardware-baseline.sh 10 > sheng-performance.txt
```

It records boot timing, CPU and device-frequency policy, Nix build parallelism
and cgroup weights, idle residency, thermals, PSI, MGLRU/THP state, zram
statistics, OOMD state, storage counters, power supplies, hardware services,
coredumps, and kernel warnings. It does not collect SSIDs, IP addresses, or MAC
addresses. Review a report before publishing it because kernel and service logs
can still contain device-specific details.

For a useful A/B comparison, collect three normal boots and the same workload on
both generations. Compare boot time, `memory full` PSI, zram compression ratio,
OOMD actions, application survival, temperature, and idle residency. A single
benchmark run is not enough to justify governor or clock changes.

## Override Or Roll Back

Downstream configurations can change the zram limit or disable the policy:

```nix
{
  services.sheng-performance = {
    zramMemoryPercent = 35;
    protectUserSessions = false;
    protectInteractiveWorkloads = true;
    buildMaxJobs = 2;
    buildCores = 4;
    buildCpuWeight = 50;
    buildIoPriority = 6;
    # enable = false;
  };
}
```

Set `protectInteractiveWorkloads = false` to restore upstream automatic Nix
parallelism and daemon priorities. Disabling the whole module restores all upstream
NixOS defaults; neither action alters the kernel, boot image, or Android
partitions. An explicit command-line `--max-jobs` can still override the default.

## Device Validation: 2026-08-31

The pre-change running system used `vm.swappiness=60`, `vm.page-cluster=3`, and
had no cgroups under `Memory Pressure Monitored CGroups` in `oomctl dump`. After
a device-side stage-2 rebuild and a normal reboot, sheng reported:

- `vm.swappiness=100` and `vm.page-cluster=0`;
- `/user.slice` and its application descendants monitored at 80% pressure for
  30 seconds;
- no failed units or coredumps;
- ADSP, pd-mapper, sensor PD, iio-sensor-proxy, NetworkManager, and the display
  manager active with zero restarts;
- zero idle memory PSI and no recurrence of the build-time GPU warning after
  reboot.

The rebuild is not a before/after performance benchmark. A first-time Rnote
source build dominated it, taking 28 minutes 54 seconds and reaching 5.7 GiB of
RAM plus 7.2 GiB of swap. One Adreno GMU performance-vote timeout occurred under
that pre-activation load and did not recur after reboot.

The second policy batch therefore leaves CPU, GPU, and UFS clocks alone. It
reduces device-side build parallelism and CPU/I/O contention priority to target desktop
responsiveness and peak pressure. It is not expected to reduce total compile
time; that requires an A/B test with identical sources and cache state.

The validation boot took 36.082 seconds, but stage-1 logs show that 14.8 seconds
were a scheduled full ext4 check after 12 mounts. Userspace reached
`graphical.target` in 11.513 seconds, close to the 11.216-second prior sample.
Keep the ext4 check in comparisons: it protects the writable root filesystem and
is unrelated to this memory policy.
