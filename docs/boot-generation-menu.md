# Sheng boot generation menu

[English](boot-generation-menu.md) | [简体中文](boot-generation-menu_zh.md)

Sheng uses a fixed Android `boot_b` image and selectable NixOS stage-2
generations from the writable `linux` partition.

Every boot displays the generation menu and automatically enters the newest
generation after three seconds without input. Pressing a navigation key pauses
the countdown. The running system can also reboot directly back to the menu:

```sh
sudo sheng-reboot-generation-menu
```

The command reboots the device; opening the menu no longer depends on a
timing-sensitive triple-press gesture.

The framebuffer UI presents generation details on two levels together with the
current position, button icons, and an automatic-boot progress indicator. The
selected generation has a high-contrast highlight and direction marker.

The static design follows the original rounded battery screen: black background,
Inter type, 32px rounded generation cards, a mint-filled selection and a dark
rounded arrow. Other entries use soft dark cards; the position badge and physical
button hints are pill-shaped. Scrollbars, the countdown track and boot handoff
use rounded ends as well. The column is narrower with more space between cards,
without animated transitions. The charging screen is unchanged. Up to eight
generations are shown per page; smaller displays show fewer rows.
Inter coverage masks and matching text metrics are
baked during the painter build. Stage-1 needs neither Python nor a font engine.
Font attribution is embedded in `sheng-fb-painter --font-license`.

The menu and painter must ship together in the new `boot_b`: glyph commands use
the previously reserved SFB1 record byte. Existing rectangle-only charging
frames remain compatible with the new painter. Updating only stage-2 does not
update this menu. The rounded menu itself affects stage-1. The accompanying
[boot animation](boot-animation.md) also changes cmdline and stage-2 services;
deploy matching boot_b and system generation/rootfs for the complete flow. Physical display acceptance of this redesign is still pending.

- Volume up/down or an external keyboard's up/down arrows change the
  highlighted stage-2 generation.
- The highlight advances within the current page and only switches pages after
  moving past that page's final entry.
- Holding a navigation key repeats the selection movement.
- Volume key handling is edge-triggered, so selection redraw does not wait for
  a delayed key-release event.
- Power or an external keyboard's Enter key confirms the selection.
- The highlighted entry boots automatically after three seconds; moving the
  selection pauses the countdown.
- The menu draws directly to the framebuffer and adapts its panel and visible
  row count to the display dimensions.
- Generation numbers and date/version details use separate visual levels, so a
  long version does not compete with the row title.
- The timeout uses both a status label and progress bar. Moving the selection
  changes it to a clearly paused state.
- If framebuffer rendering is unavailable, the menu falls back to a tty text
  interface instead of accepting input on a blank display.
- Only changed selections, scroll windows, or timeout state are redrawn,
  avoiding periodic full-screen writes and flicker.
- Console input echo and VT keyboard translation are disabled while the menu is
  active, preventing physical volume keys from printing escape sequences over
  the menu.
- Kernel console logging is temporarily suppressed while the menu is active,
  preventing asynchronous driver logs from overwriting it.
- Each generation row is cleared before redraw to avoid display remnants after
  moving the selection.
- The menu always keeps using the kernel, DTB, stage-1 initrd, and command line
  from the flashed `boot_b`.

## Manual-selection handoff

Qualcomm SSC services have a boot-time registration window. Letting stage-1
wait indefinitely while a user browses generations can leave `sensor_pd`
unavailable even though the selected NixOS generation itself is healthy.

For this reason, an untouched three-second automatic boot continues directly,
but any manually confirmed selection uses a two-boot handoff:

1. Stage-1 writes the exact selected generation to
   `/var/lib/sheng-boot-menu/pending-generation`, syncs the mounted rootfs, and
   performs a quick reboot.
2. The next stage-1 validates the pending path against the generations that
   still exist, deletes the marker before use, skips the menu, and enters that
   generation immediately.

The marker is one-shot and a stale or invalid path is ignored, so it cannot
create a persistent reboot loop. The extra reboot happens only after manual
input; normal boots remain a single boot.

Do not hold either volume key while powering on the tablet. Before Linux starts,
the Xiaomi bootloader interprets volume up as Recovery and volume down as
Fastboot. Wait for the generation menu before using the volume keys.

The menu is implemented without the Mobile NixOS LVGL splash because enabling
the graphical stage-1 path previously blocked sheng from reaching stage-2.

Building or changing this menu affects the Android boot image and requires
flashing `boot_b`. Creating, selecting, switching, or rolling back stage-2
generations does not require flashing.

## Verification

The `generationMenuRenderer` flake check exercises mruby input/navigation and
the actual native painter. It compares incremental frames against full redraws
across page boundaries, wraparound, and selection changes at 3048x2032,
2032x3048 and 1280x720, with padded strides at 16/24/32 bpp. Empty lists and the
boot handoff screen are rendered as well. The offline-charging check must also
pass because both interfaces use the painter.

For host-only previews (Python needs Pillow; mruby is also required), first
build the painter for the host architecture, then run:

```sh
mruby nixos/tests/test-stage1-generation-menu-renderer.rb \
  nixos/patches/stage-1-headless-generation-menu.rb /tmp/menu.fbops \
  "$PAINTER/share/sheng/menu-font.rb"
python3 scripts/preview-generation-menu.py /tmp/menu.fbops \
  "$PAINTER/bin/sheng-fb-painter" --output /tmp/menu-preview
```

`PAINTER` is the host-built package output. Preview PNGs come from native
framebuffer bytes, not a separate mockup. Host checks are not a substitute for
testing the flashed boot image.

Before testing the menu, confirm at least two generations exist:

```sh
PAGER=cat nix-env --profile /nix/var/nix/profiles/system --list-generations
```

Test both a normal boot and `sudo sheng-reboot-generation-menu`. Spend at least
15 seconds in the menu, choose an older generation, and confirm with the power
key. Verify that the tablet reboots once, skips the menu, and enters the chosen
generation. Also connect a USB keyboard and test the arrow keys and Enter.
After boot:

```sh
readlink /nix/var/nix/profiles/system
readlink -f /run/current-system
systemctl --failed --no-pager
systemctl show adsprpcd-sensorspd iio-sensor-proxy \
  -p Id -p ActiveState -p NRestarts
test ! -e /var/lib/sheng-boot-menu/pending-generation
```

If the menu does not appear, the previous known-good `boot_b` image is the
rollback path for menu failures.
